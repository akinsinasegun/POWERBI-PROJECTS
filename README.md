# HUMAN RESOURCES ANALYTICS-PROJECTS

## INTRODUCTION
This presentation delves into a compelling Case Study featuring a dataset containing details regarding an organization's workforce. Upon an in-depth examination of this dataset, it becomes evident that a multitude of critical metrics can be harnessed to yield invaluable insights. The significance of this analysis cannot be overstated; its findings are poised to empower stakeholders, management, and the Human Capital team with the knowledge required to make well-informed decisions. 
By conducting an exploratory analysis on the dataset and leveraging an intuitive dashboard, I have distilled the data into easily comprehensible insights, facilitating the path to sound decision-making and answering important questions sked in the case study.
